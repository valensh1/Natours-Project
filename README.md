## Knowledge Gained From This Project

* Tons of modern cutting-edge CSS techniques to create stunning designs and effects: clip-path, background-clip, mask-image, background-blend-mode, shape-outside, filter, backdrop-filter, object-fit, transform, column-count, hyphens, perspective, calc() and custom CSS properties.

* Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition.

* Advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements required for modern CSS development.

* How CSS works behind the scenes: the cascade, specificity, inheritance, value processing, the visual formatting model, the box model, box types, positioning schemes and stacking contexts.

* CSS architecture: The 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, writing reusable, maintainable and scalable code.

* Introduction to Sass: variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, functions, extends, and more.

* Using Sass in real-world projects: setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS and managing media queries.

* The NPM ecosystem: setting up a development process to compile Sass and automatic browser reload, and creating a build process to concatenate, prefix and compress CSS files.

* Modern responsive design: fluid grids, layout types, flexible images, using media queries to test for different screen widths, pixel densities and touch capabilities.

* Advanced responsive design workflows: mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies, selecting breakpoints, em vs rem units and feature queries to test for browser support.

* Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads: resolution switching, density switching, art direction.

* SVG images in HTML and CSS: how and why to use SVG, generating SVG sprites, changing SVG colours in CSS and best practices.

* Videos in HTML and CSS: building a background video effect.

* How to architect and build a simple grid system with floats.  This project uses float layout.
