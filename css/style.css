MEDIA QUERY MANAGER 

0 - 600px:          Phone
600 - 900px:        Tablet Portrait
900 - 1200px:       Tablet Landscape
[1200 - 1800px]:    Where our normal styles apply
1800px +:           Big desktop

--> rem's don't work good for media queries for certain browsers so even though we used rem throughout our project we are going to use em's here which work much better with media queries 
--> 1em = 16px
--> convert screen sizes above into em's
        > Phone = 600px / 16px = 37.5em
        > Phone = 900px / 16px = 56.25em
        > Phone = 1200px / 16px = 75em
        > Phone = 1800px / 16px = 112.5em

    ALWAYS INCLUDE BIGGER SCREENS FIRST AND SMALLER SCREENS LAST
    Reason for this is if you have a screen size that is 500 px. Well that screen size meets the requirements for all the media queries because 500 is less than all our major breakpoints such as its less than 1800 its less than 1200 which is less than 900 etc. So when
    there are conflicting media queries the one that is included last in the code takes precedence thats why we start with the biggest media queries on top and go smaller when doing Desktop to Mobile design.
